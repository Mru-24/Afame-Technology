## Task 2: Iris-Classification
#### We utilize Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on measurements of their sepals and petals. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that works by finding the best possible boundary to separate different classes in a high-dimensional space. By leveraging SVM, we aim to accurately categorize Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species. Through this project, we not only demonstrate the practical application of SVM in classification tasks but also gain insights into its effectiveness with real-world datasets. Ultimately, our goal is to showcase the utility of SVM in Iris flower classification and its broader implications for machine learning applications.

## Task 3: Sales Prediction using python
#### Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.Here we have implemented Linear regression algorithm to predict the sales of advertising sources such as TV, Newspaper and Radio. In this case we have predicted the sales of TV and plotted the best fit regression line after predicting the sales of TV.
